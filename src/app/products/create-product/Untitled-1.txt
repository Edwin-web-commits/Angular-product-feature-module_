1. Angular encourages and supports modular appproach of apps
2. Two different appproaches
  2.1 Generating modules -> Orders.
  2.2 Generating modules via lazy loading -> Products
3. Generating Modules  
   3.1 run the command 
       ng g m <module-name>
   3.2 Then navigate inside the orders module
       ng g c list-orders    (generating the list-orders component inside Orders module)
   3.3 To use this Orders module, we need to import it in the App module
       -then add the module into the Imports array of App module
 4. Generating Module using Lazy loading      
     ng g m products --route products --module app.module

 5. We are going to update the products feature module's routing file
     All the routes we need in our feature module
     5.1 create-product -> adding new product (CREATE)
     5.2 list-products ->list of all products (READ)
     5.3 search?category ->list products by category (READ)
     5.4 search?date -> list products by date (READ)
     5.5 delete-product -> delete the product (DELETE)
     5.6 view-product/id -> view a specific product (READ)  
     5.7 update-product/id ->update a specific product (UPDATE)

CREATE
Important things to remember when creating a form template
 1.Give the form a name using "template ref" -we define it using #
   #f="ngForm"
 2.Give all the fields attribute name and ngModel
    -this is one way data binding
 3. on submit event -> (ngSubmit)="addNewProductForm(f)"
 4.always remember to import FormsModule   

 UPDATE
 1. FIRST  we will capture the product Id of the selected product
 2. we will read the existing data of the product
 3. We will use tow way data binding to map the fields on the screen
 4.We do a PUT method call to update the product
